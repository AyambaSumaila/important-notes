## My learning notes

This repository has the following purposes:

- a notebook - for quicker understanding of what I read
- a summary - to quickly go back to what I read
- a log - for the record when and what I read
- a contract - to be systematic in reading

Notes in this repo are focused mostly on Python, Machine Learning and Architecture.

### Typora

I use **Typora** to write the notes. If you really need to read my notes, I strongly encourage you to open them in Typora because of much better formatting:

###### Typora:

![readme-formatting-typora](./_images/readme-formatting-typora.png)

###### GitHub in the browser...:

![readme-formatting-github](./_images/readme-formatting-github.png)

Typora is truly superior :slightly_smiling_face:
