## My learning notes

This repository has the following purposes:

- a notebook - for quicker understanding of what I read
- a summary - to quickly go back to what I read
- a log - for the record when and what I read
- a contract - to be systematic in reading

Notes in this repo are focused mostly on Python, Machine Learning and Architecture.
