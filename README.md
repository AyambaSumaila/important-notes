## My learning notes

I use **Typora** to write the notes. If you really need to read my notes, I strongly encourage you to open them in Typora because of much better formatting:

###### Typora:

###### GitHub in the browser...:

![readme-formatting-github](./_images/readme-formatting-github.png)

Typora is truly superior :)



Notes are created while reading the books to help me understand various concepts better and faster. I recommend this method :)
