## 1: Transformation

Instead of taking a waterfall approach to your agile transformation, take an iterative one and grow the scope
organically. Focus on changing the organizational culture to align with an agile one.

Product Owners don't dictate anything just because they are accountable for maximizing the value through effective
product backlog. The entire Scrum Team collaborates on creating a plan for the next Sprint.

Asses the psychological safety in your organization. If it is too low, seek to make working agreements where blameless
post-mortems are part of them, so you can create a culture of promoting healthy conflicts and celebration of mistakes (
and learning from them). Help your managers in demanding more psychological safety from their superiors, as that is a
prerequisite for the managers creating it for you.

If you only partly adopted the agile way of working, the scope and time might be fixed, so the only parameter that the
teams can rally vary is how much technical debt to create.
