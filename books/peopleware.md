## Chapter 1: Somewhere today, a project is failing

"Politics" is the most frequently cited cause of failure. "Politics" for people mean: communication problems, staffing
problems, lack of motivation, and high turnover. English language provides a much more precise term - sociology.

> The major problems of our work are not so much technological as sociological in nature.

We tend to focus on the technical rather than the human side of the work, because it is easier to do: new hard drive
installation vs figuring out why somebody is dissatisfied with the company.

Manager should concentrate on sociology, not on technology. Human interactions are complicated and never very crisp and
clean in their effects, but they matter more than any other aspect of work.

## Chapter 2: Make a cheeseburger, sell a cheeseburger

The "make a cheeseburger, sell a cheeseburger" mentality, can be fatal in your development area:

- Make the machine (the human machine) run as smoothly as possible
- Take a hard line about people goofing off on the job
- Treat workers as interchangeable pieces of the machine
- Optimize the steady state
- Standardize procedure, do everything by the book
- Eliminate experimentation - that's what the folks at the headquarters are paid for

To manage thinking workers effectively, managers should take measures nearly opposite to those listed above:

- encourage people to make some errors - ask people what dead-end roads they have been down, and making sure they
  understand that "none" is not the best answer
- you may be able to kick the people to make them active, but not to make them creative, inventive and thoughtful, there
  is nothing more discouraging to any worker than the sense that his own motivation is inadequate and has to be
  "supplemented" by the boss
- every worker is unique, uniqueness is what makes project chemistry vital and effective
- the catalyst is important because the project is always in a state of flux, someone who can help a project to jell is
  worth two people who just do work - managers pay too little attention to how well each team member fits into the
  effort as a whole
- workers need time for brainstorming, investigating new methods, figuring out how to avoid doing some subtasks,
  reading, training, and just goofing off

## Chapter 3: Vienna waits for you

Your people are aware of the one short life that each person is allotted. There has to be something more important than
the silly hob they are working on.

Overtime - for every hour of overtime, there will be more or less an hour of undertime. The trade-off might work to
management's advantage in the short term, but in the long term it will cancel out.

Overtime is like sprinting: it makes some sense for the last 100m of the marathon for those with any energy left, but if
you start sprinting in the first kilometer, you are wasting time.

Workaholism is an illness, but common-cold-like, everyone has a bout of it now and then. If a manager tries to exploit
workaholics, they wil eventually loose them.

Realization that one has sacrificed a more important value (family, love, home, youth) for a less important value (work)
is devastating.

Typical things companies do to improve productivity, they make the work less enjoyable and less interesting:

- pressure people to put in more hours
- mechanize the process of product deployment
- compromise the quality of the product
- standardize procedures

Next time you hear someone talking about productivity, listen carefully to hear if the speaker uses the term "employee
turnover". Chances are low.

> People under time pressure don't work better - they just work faster.

In order to work faster, they may have to sacrifice the quality of the product and of their work experience.

## Chapter 4: Quality - if time permits

Man's character is dominated by a small number of basic instincts: survival, self-esteem, reproduction, territory, ...
Even the slightest challenge to one of these built-in values can be upsetting.

We all tend to tie our self-esteem to the quality of the product we produce. Any step you take that may jeopardize the
quality of the product is likely to set the emotions of your staff directly against you.

Workers kept under extreme time pressure will begin to sacrifice quality. They will hate what they are doing, but what
other choice do they have?

> Some of my folks would tinker forever on a task, all in teh name of _QUALITY_. But the market doesn't give a damn
> about that much quality - it is screaming for the product to be delivered yesterday and will accept it even in a
> quick-and-dirty state

**WRONG.** The builders' view of quality is very different - their self-esteem is strongly tied to the quality of the
product, they tend to impose quality standards of their own.

_Quality, for beyond that required by the end user, is a means to higher productivity._

In some Japanese companies, the project team has an effective power of veto over delivery of what they believe to be a
not-yet-ready product. No matter that the client would be willing to accept even a substandard product, the team can
insist that delivery wait until its own standards are achieved.
