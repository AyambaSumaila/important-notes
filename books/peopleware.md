## Chapter 1: Somewhere today, a project is failing

"Politics" is the most frequently cited cause of failure. "Politics" for people mean: communication problems, staffing
problems, lack of motivation, and high turnover. English language provides a much more precise term - sociology.

> The major problems of our work are not so much technological as sociological in nature.

We tend to focus on the technical rather than the human side of the work, because it is easier to do: new hard drive
installation vs figuring out why somebody is dissatisfied with the company.

Manager should concentrate on sociology, not on technology. Human interactions are complicated and never very crisp and
clean in their effects, but they matter more than any other aspect of work.

## Chapter 2: Make a cheeseburger, sell a cheeseburger

The "make a cheeseburger, sell a cheeseburger" mentality, can be fatal in your development area:

- Make the machine (the human machine) run as smoothly as possible
- Take a hard line about people goofing off on the job
- Treat workers as interchangeable pieces of the machine
- Optimize the steady state
- Standardize procedure, do everything by the book
- Eliminate experimentation - that's what the folks at the headquarters are paid for

To manage thinking workers effectively, managers should take measures nearly opposite to those listed above:

- encourage people to make some errors - ask people what dead-end roads they have been down, and making sure they
  understand that "none" is not the best answer
- you may be able to kick the people to make them active, but not to make them creative, inventive and thoughtful, there
  is nothing more discouraging to any worker than the sense that his own motivation is inadequate and has to be
  "supplemented" by the boss
- every worker is unique, uniqueness is what makes project chemistry vital and effective
- the catalyst is important because the project is always in a state of flux, someone who can help a project to jell is
  worth two people who just do work - managers pay too little attention to how well each team member fits into the
  effort as a whole
- workers need time for brainstorming, investigating new methods, figuring out how to avoid doing some subtasks,
  reading, training, and just goofing off
