# Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software

## Chapter 1: Crunching Knowledge

Effective modeling:

- Binding model and the implementation
- Cultivating a language based on the model
- Developing a knowledge-rich model
- Distilling the model - drop unneeded concepts
- Brainstorming and experimenting

Effective domain modelers are knowledge crunchers (take a torrent of information and prove it for relevant trickle). Knowledge crunching is a collaborative work, typically led by developers in cooperation with domain experts. Early versions or prototypes feed experience back into the team and change interpretations.

All projects lack knowledge - people leave, team reorganisations happen - in general, knowledge is lost. Highly productive teams grow their knowledge continuously - improve technical knowledge along with general domain-modeling skills, but also seriously learn about specific domain they are working on. The accumulated knowledge makes them effective knowledge crunchers.

Software is unable to fill in gaps with common sense - that is why knowledge crunching is important.

Example with overbooking strategy: overbooking check should be extracted from the booking functionality to be more explicit and visible. This is example fo domain modeling and securing and sharing knowledge.
