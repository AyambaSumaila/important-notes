## Chapter 1: The Interview Process

Assessment of a candidate performance:

- Analytical skills: Did you need much help to solve the problem? How optimal was your solution? How long did it take
  you to arrive at a solution?
- Coding skills: Were you able to successfully translate your algorithm to reasonable code? Was it clean and
  well-organized? Did you think of potential errors? Did you use good style?
- Technical knowledge: Do you have a strong foundation in computer science and the relevant technologies?
- Experience: Have you made good technical decisions in the past? Have you built interesting, challenging projects? Have
  you shown drive, initiative, and other important factors?
- Culture fit: Do your personality and values fit with the company and team? Did you communicate well with your
  interviewer?

False negatives are acceptable. Some good candidates are rejected. The company is out to build a great set of employees.
They can accept that they miss out on some good people. Company is far more concerned with false positives: people who
do well in an interview but are not in fact very good.

Basic data structure and algorithm knowledge is useful. It is a good proxy. These skills are not hard to learn, but are
well-correlated with being a good developer. Also, it is hard to ask problem-solving questions that don't involve
algorithms and data structures.

Your interviewer develops a feel for your performance by comparing you to other people. Getting a hard question sin;t a
bad thing. When it is harder fot you, it is harder for everyone.

If you haven't heard back from a company within 3-5 business days after interview, check in with your recruiter.

You can almost always re-apply to a company after getting rejected. Typically, you have to wait between 6-12 months.

## Chapter 2: Behind the Scenes

"Bar raiser" interviewer is charged with keeping the interview bar high. This person has significant experience with
interviews and veto power in the hiring decision.

## Chapter 3: Special situations

**Experienced candidates.** More experienced engineers might see slightly less focus on algorithm questions. Some
interviewers might hold experienced candidates to a somewhat lower standard. After all, it has been years since these
candidates took an algorithms class. Others though hold experienced candidates to a higher standard. On average it
balances out.

The exception to this rule is system design and architecture questions. Performance in such interview questions would be
evaluated with respect to your experience level.

Personality fit: Typically assessed by how you interact with your interviewer. Establishing a friendly, engaging
conversation with your interviewers is your ticket to many job offers.

**For interviewers.**

- Don't actually ask the exact questions in here. You can ask similar questions to these. Some candidates are reading
  this book. Your goal is to test their problem-solving skills, not their memorization skills.
- Ask Medium and Hard problems.When you ask questions that are too easy, performance gets clustered together.
- Use hard questions, not hard knowledge. If your question expects obscure knowledge, ask yourself: is this truly an
  important skill? Most won't remember Dijkstra's algorithm or the specifics of how AVL trees work.
- Avoid "scary" questions. Some questions intimidate candidates, because it seems like they involve some specialized
  knowledge, even if they really don't - math or probability, low-level knowledge, system design or scalability,
  proprietary systems (e.g. Google Maps). If you are going to ask a question that sounds "scary", make sure you really
  reassure candidates that it doesn't require the knowledge that they think it does.
- Offer positive reinforcement. You want candidates to feel comfortable. A candidate who is nervous will perform poorly,
  and it doesn't mean that they aren't good. Moreover, a good candidate who has a negative reaction to you or tgo the
  company is less likely to accept an offer - and they may dissuade their friends from interviewing/accepting as well.
  No matter how poorly a candidate is doing, there is always something they got right. Find a way to infuse some
  positivity into the interview.
- Coach your candidates.
    - Many candidates don't use an example to solve a question. Guide them.
    - Some candidates take a long time to find the bug because they use an enormous example. They didn't realize it
      would be more efficient to analyze their code conceptually first, or that a small example would work nearly as
      well. Guide them.
    - If they dive into code before they have an optimal solution, pull them back and focus them on the algorithm.
    - If they get nervous and stuck and aren't sure where to go, suggest to them that they walk through the brute force
      solution and look for areas to optimize.
    - Remind them that they can start off with a brute solution. Their first solution doesn't have to be perfect.
- If they want silence, give them silence. If your candidate needs this, give your candidate time to think.
- Know your mode: sanity check, quality, specialist, and proxy.
    - Sanity Check - Easy problem-solving or design questions. They assess a minimum degree of competence. You can use
      them early in the process.
    - Quality Check - More challenging questions. Designed to be more rigorous and make a candidate think.
    - Specialist Questions - Test knowledge on specific topics, e.g. Java or machine learning.
    - Proxy Knowledge - This is knowledge that is not quite at the specialist level, but that you would expect a
      candidate at their level to know.
