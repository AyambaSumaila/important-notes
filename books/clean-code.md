#### Chapter 1: Clean Code

- ugly code is expensive
- take your time to write a good code
- bad code programmer's fault, not PO's, manager's or anyone's else
- bad code is like a building with broken windows - people see ugly building and stop caring
- code like a prose, code should look like you care
- make the language look like it was made of the problem
- code rot quickly
