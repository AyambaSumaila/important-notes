## 1.1 Adulthood

When you are looking at the array of potential careers before you, the correct place to start is "What do I want to
learn?"

- NOT: How much money do I want to make?
- NOT: What title do I want to have?
- NOT: What company has enough name recognition?

Early adulthood is about watching your dreams go up in flames and learning as much as you can from the ashes.

Go where you can grow - people, mission, the opportunity are all that matters.

> The only failure is your twenties is inaction. The rest is trial and error.

Humans learn through productive struggle, by trying it themselves and screwing up and doing it differently next time.
You have to push yourself to the mountain, even if it means you might fall of a cliff.

## 1.2 Get a job

If you are going to throw your time, energy, and youth at a company, try to join one that's not just making a better
mousetrap. Find a business that's starting a revolution:

- it's creating a product that's wholly new or combines existing technology in a novel way that the competition can't
  make or even understand
- this product solves a problem - a real pain point - that a lot of customers experience daily
- the novel technology can deliver on the company vision
- leadership is not dogmatic about what the solution looks like and is willing to adapt to their customers' needs
- it's thinking about a problem or a customer need in a way you've never heard before, but makes a perfect sense once
  you hear it

Cool technology isn't enough, a great team isn't enough, plenty of funding isn't enough. You have to time you product
right. The world has to be ready to want it. If you're not solving a real problem, you can;t start a revolution.

Seemingly impossible problems that a decade ago would have cost billions to solve, requiring massive investments from
gian firms, can now be figured out with a smartphone app, a small sensor, and the internet.

If you are passionate about something - something that could be solving a huge problem one day - then stick with it.
Because one day, if you are truly solving a real issue, when the world is ready to want it, you will already be there.

You don't have to an executive right away, you don't have to get a job at the most amazing, world-changing company out
of college, but you should have a goal.
